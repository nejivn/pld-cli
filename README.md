**For Scoop users:**
Try reinstalling:
```bash
scoop uninstall pld-cli
scoop install pld-cli
```

**For manual installation:**
Try running:
```bash
npm unlink
npm link
```

Or restart your terminal.

### Upload fails with 401/403 error

Your API key is invalid or expired. Reconfigure it:
```bash
pld --config
```

### Google Drive authorization issues

If you encounter authorization errors:
1. Run `pld --config` and select Google Drive
2. Choose **Re-authorize** to get a new token
3. Make sure you've added `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a redirect URI in Google Cloud Console

### Network errors

- Verify the service is accessible (Gofile/Pixeldrain/Google)
- Check if you're behind a proxy or firewall

### File not found
